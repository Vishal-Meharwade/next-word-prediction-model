       "'Following a lavish state visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Washington, US President Joe Biden has called his country\\'s partnership with India among the \"most consequential in the world\". The BBC\\'s Vikas Pandey and Soutik Biswas explore the factors that contribute to the visit\\'s potential in strengthening the ties between the two nations.\\n\\nThe US\\'s relationship with India - the world\\'s most populous country - is \"stronger, closer and more dynamic than any time in history\", Mr Biden said at the completion of a pomp-filled state visit by Mr Modi to the White House.\\n\\nThe remark may not be an exaggeration. \"This summit suggests that the relationship has been transformed. It underscores just how broad and deep it has become in a relatively short time,\" says Michael Kugelman of The Wilson Center, an American think-tank.\\n\\nA key reason is that Washington is keen to draw India closer so that it can act as a counterbalance to China\\'s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific. India-US ties had not lived up to their promise following a landmark civilian nuclear deal in 2005 because a liability law passed by India three years later hobbled purchase of reactors.\\n\\n\"This followed a fading commitment to the relationship during [former prime minister] Manmohan Singh\\'s second term as the leader of a coalition government. With Mr Modi there has been a lot more enthusiasm about embracing the US. Mr Biden has also given an overall broad directive to make it work,\" says Seema Sirohi, author of Friends With Benefits: The India-US Story.\\n\\nMs Sirohi says the US put in a \"lot of effort to make Mr Modi\\'s visit substantive and have a lot of deliverables\". Defence-industrial cooperation and technology topped the list. Consider this:\\n\\nGeneral Electric and India\\'s state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited will make in India advanced fighter jet engines for the country\\'s indigenous light combat aircraft. This means a \"greater transfer of US jet engine technology than ever before\" - a clear sign that Washington not only wants to sell arms to India but is also comfortable with sharing military technology.\\nIndia will proceed with a $3bn purchase of the battle-tested MQ-9B Predator drones from General Atomics, which will also set up a facility in India. The drones will be assembled in India, which fits into Mr Modi\\'s \\'Make in India\\' campaign. The US supplies only 11% of India\\'s arms - Russia is the biggest (45%) supplier - but hopes to become the primary provider in the coming years. Mr Kugelman says Washington\\'s immediate goal is to \"strengthen India\\'s military capacity to counter China\".\\nMr Modi wants to make India a semiconductor base. US memory chip giant Micron Technology will invest up to $825m to build a semiconductor assembly and test facility in India, creating thousands of jobs.\\nUS semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research will train 60,000 Indian engineers through a network of interconnected labs and research centres to speed up India\\'s semiconductor education and workforce development. Also Applied Materials, the biggest maker of machines for producing semiconductors, will invest $400m to establish an engineering centre in India.\\n\"It is all about the future now. Both sides are talking about cutting-edge technologies and how to seed and shape the future,\" says Ms Sirohi.\\n\\n: U.S. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden welcome India Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the White House on June 21, 2023 in Washington, DC\\nMr Biden and Mrs Biden welcome Mr Modi to the White House\\nThe India-US relationship has seen many ups and downs since the US seriously began courting India - first under President Bill Clinton and then under the George Bush administration. The response from India was measured, never overeager or too forthcoming.\\n\\nThe reason was the way India saw geopolitics and its own place in the global order. The strategy of nonalignment, started by India\\'s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, has always been deeply rooted into India\\'s foreign policy.\\n\\nIndia never wanted to be seen in one camp or the other, or to be seen as junior strategic partner to a global superpower. Mr Modi has not left the ideals of what some describe as \"strategic altruism\" in Indian foreign policy.\\n\\nBut Mr Modi is leading a different kind of India, one which has considerably more economic and geopolitical heft. He has owned the India-US relations - he formed close bonds with former presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump and now with Mr Biden.\\n\\nBut India\\'s \"strategic autonomy\" has not been sacrificed. Washington would have wanted India to go a step further on Russia and probably take a harder public stand on China.\\n\\nBut the Biden administration didn\\'t seem disappointed as Mr Modi repeated his line that \"this was not the era of war\" without mentioning Russia. The Indian prime minister did speak about the importance of beefing up humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. He didn\\'t mention China by name either but did talk about the importance of a free and prosperous Indo-Pacific.\\n\\nThis is how far Mr Modi could have pushed his administration\\'s policy without compromising on strategic autonomy. It may not have been the ideal way for Washington but it didn\\'t come in the way of making Mr Modi\\'s visit a success.\\n\\nThe United States Air Force (USAF) and Indian Air Force (IAF) personnel are posing in front of a United States Air Force (USAF) F-15 Eagle fighter jet during the joint \\'Exercise Cope India 2023\\' at the air force station in Kalaikunda, around 170 km west of Kolkata, on April 24th, 2023. \\nUS and Indian air force personnel pose in front of a US fighter jet during a joint exercise in India in April\\n\"The two militaries are working more closely together. They now have arrangements in place where they could use each other\\'s facilities for refuelling and maintenance purposes. They are holding joint exercises and they\\'re sharing a lot more intelligence. Credit to Mr Modi for managing to really test the limits of strategic autonomy. In the sense that he is getting about as close as you can to a major power without signing on to a full-fledged alliance,\" Mr Kugelman says.\\n\\nIndia and the US have had major trade differences in recent years over tariffs. Trade relations particularly suffered during the Trump administration.\\n\\nThe two sides were not expected to announce anything major in trade as it was understood that the discussions over that could continue later without overshadowing the visit.\\n\\nBut surprisingly, the two sides announced that six separate trade disputes at the World Trade Organization were resolved, including one that involved tariffs.\\n\\nThe US is now India\\'s top trading partner at $130bn in goods and Delhi is Washington\\'s eighth largest partner. While these numbers are impressive, analysts and policymakers feel there is a huge untapped potential. India is also a burgeoning market with an expanding middle class and it\\'s been positioning itself as an alternative to China to become a manufacturing hub for the world.\\n\\nPresident Joe Biden and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi participate in an arrival ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House on Thursday, June 22, 2023 in Washington, DC. President Biden is the first U.S. President to invite Prime Minister Modi for an official state visit\\nSome 2.7 million Indians live in the US\\nMany global firms and nations are interested in the proposal as they look to free the global supply chain from China\\'s dominance. In that context, the resolution of trade disputes will give further impetus to unlocking the full potential of India-US trade ties. Mr Modi has said that \"even sky is not the limit (for India-US) ties\".\\n\\nCritics in Washington have questioned India\\'s \"democratic backsliding\" under Mr Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Mr Obama, in a television interview this week, emphasised the significance of addressing the \"protection of the Muslim minority in a predominantly Hindu India\" during discussions between Mr Biden and Mr Modi. \"The progressives in the Democratic Party are disturbed by what is happening in India. The realists and centrists are all for strengthening the relationship because of the China factor,\" says Ms Sirohi.\\n\\nBut on the whole, there is a bipartisan agreement to make the relationship deeper and broader. \"The India-US strategic partnership has certainly moved to the next level. It\\'s one of mutual need and mutual benefit,\" says Ms Sirohi.\\n\\nIn a faraway kingdom nestled between rolling hills and lush forests, there existed a mysterious garden. Legends whispered of its existence, claiming it held magical properties that could bring forth the most vibrant and miraculous flora known to mankind.\\n\\nPrince Leo, a kind-hearted and adventurous soul, grew up hearing tales of this enchanted garden from his grandmother, the queen dowager. She would regale him with stories of its beauty and the wondrous plants that bloomed within its borders. These tales ignited a spark of curiosity within the young prince.\\n\\nOn a bright spring morning, when the sun painted the sky in hues of gold and amber, Prince Leo embarked on a quest to find this legendary garden. With determination in his heart and a map handed down by his grandmother, he rode his trusted steed, Ember, through meadows and across babbling brooks.\\n\\nDays turned into weeks as Leo traversed through thick forests and climbed treacherous mountains. At times, he faced adversity—storms that lashed out fiercely and paths obscured by dense foliage. Yet, fueled by his unwavering determination, he pressed on, guided by the stories etched in his mind.\\n\\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity of searching, Leo stumbled upon a hidden grove, concealed by vines and towering trees. A feeling of awe swept over him as he beheld the spectacle before his eyes—the fabled garden.\\n\\nThe air carried a sweet fragrance, and a gentle breeze rustled through blossoms of every shade imaginable. Flowers with petals that shimmered like precious gems and trees that bore fruits glowing with an ethereal light adorned the garden. It was a spectacle that surpassed even the most fantastical of tales.\\n\\nAs Leo explored the garden\\'s winding paths, he came across a shimmering pond at its heart. Within its crystal-clear waters danced fish adorned with scales of iridescent colors. At the center of the pond floated a single, radiant lily—a lily rumored to possess unparalleled healing powers.\\n\\nFilled with wonder and a desire to uncover the secrets held within this enchanted realm, Leo approached the lily. As he reached out to touch its delicate petals, a voice echoed in his mind, soft and melodious.\\n\\n\"Brave soul, your heart led you here, seeking the wonders of this garden. But heed my words, for the magic within comes with great responsibility.\"\\n\\nStartled, Leo turned around to see a luminous figure materialize—a spirit of the garden. She revealed herself as Aurora, the guardian of this mystical realm. Her eyes held centuries of wisdom, and her presence exuded an otherworldly grace.\\n\\n\"Aurora,\" Leo spoke with reverence, \"I seek no harm but only to understand the magic that thrives within this place.\"\\n\\nAurora regarded him with a gentle smile. \"Your intentions are pure, young prince. The essence of this garden is boundless, but its gifts must be protected. The harmony of its existence relies on the respect and care bestowed upon it.\"\\n\\nLeo pledged to uphold the sanctity of the garden and its treasures. With Aurora\\'s guidance, he learned the secrets of nurturing the flora and tending to the needs of the wondrous plants. The healing lily revealed its powers, and Leo vowed to use it solely for the betterment of his kingdom.\\n\\nAs time passed, Prince Leo returned to his realm, carrying with him not only the knowledge of the enchanted garden but also a newfound sense of responsibility. He implemented Aurora\\'s teachings, creating gardens within the kingdom that flourished with vibrant life, bringing joy and healing to its people.\\n\\nThe tales of the prince\\'s journey spread far and wide, inspiring generations to cherish nature\\'s gifts and protect its wonders. And in the secluded grove, under the watchful eye of Aurora, the enchanted garden continued to thrive, its magic preserved for those whose hearts held pure intentions.\\n\\nOnce there was a young boy named Tom. Tom lived in a small coastal town. He loved the sea and spent many days watching boats sail by. One day, Tom saw a small island in the distance. He had never noticed it before. It seemed strange and exciting.\\n\\nTom was curious about the island. He asked his friends and family, but no one knew anything about it. This made Tom even more determined to explore it. He decided to visit the island and see what secrets it held.\\n\\nEarly one morning, Tom packed a bag with food, water, and a map. He borrowed his father\\'s old rowboat and set off towards the island. The sea was calm, and the sun was shining. Tom rowed with excitement, his heart racing with anticipation.\\n\\nAfter a few hours, Tom reached the island. It was covered with thick green trees and had a beautiful sandy beach. Tom pulled his boat onto the beach and started to explore. The island was full of wonders. There were colorful birds, exotic flowers, and strange-looking trees.\\n\\nAs Tom ventured deeper into the island, he found a clear stream. The water was cool and refreshing. He followed the stream and soon came across an old wooden chest. It was hidden under some bushes and covered in moss. Tom\\'s eyes widened with amazement. He had found a treasure chest!\\n\\nWith shaking hands, Tom opened the chest. Inside, he found old coins, shiny jewels, and a golden crown. Tom couldn\\'t believe his luck. He had discovered a real treasure! He knew this find would change his life and the lives of everyone in his town.\\n\\nTom returned to his boat with the treasure. He rowed back home, eager to share his discovery. When he reached the town, he told everyone about the island and the treasure. The townspeople were amazed and celebrated Tom\\'s discovery.\\n\\nThe treasure brought wealth and happiness to the town. Tom became a hero. He had shown bravery and curiosity, and it had paid off. The mysterious island was no longer a secret, but a symbol of adventure and fortune.\\n\\nFrom that day on, Tom continued to explore new places. He learned that sometimes, the greatest adventures are waiting just beyond the horizon. And the small, mysterious island remained a special place in his heart, a reminder of the day his life changed forever.\\n\\nOne sunny morning, John decided to go to the park. He put on his shoes, grabbed his water bottle, and left his house. The park was not far, just a short walk down the street. John liked the park because it was peaceful and beautiful.\\n\\nWhen he arrived, John saw many people. Some were walking their dogs, others were jogging, and kids were playing on the playground. He smiled and found a bench to sit on. The sun was warm, and the sky was clear and blue.\\n\\nJohn watched the people and enjoyed the fresh air. He saw birds in the trees and ducks in the pond. The sound of children laughing made him happy. He took out a book from his bag and began to read.\\n\\nAfter a while, John felt hungry. He had brought an apple and a sandwich. He ate his food and drank some water. It was a perfect day to be outside.\\n\\nThen, John saw an old woman. She looked a bit lost. He went up to her and asked if she needed help. She told him she was looking for her cat. John said he would help her look. They walked around the park, calling for the cat.\\n\\nFinally, they found the cat near a flower garden. The old woman was so thankful. She thanked John and said he was very kind. John felt good helping someone. He waved goodbye to the woman and her cat.\\n\\nJohn decided to walk around the park a bit more. He saw beautiful flowers and tall trees. He took some pictures with his phone. The park was a great place to relax and enjoy nature.\\n\\nIt was getting late, so John decided to go home. He walked back, feeling happy and refreshed. He had a nice time at the park. He saw his neighbors and waved to them. When he got home, he took off his shoes and sat down. It had been a good day.\\n\\nJohn thought about his day at the park. He had read, eaten, helped someone, and enjoyed nature. He felt grateful for the simple things in life. John decided he would go to the park more often. It was a wonderful place to spend his day.\\n\\nIn a small town, everyone was excited about the upcoming community festival. It was an event that brought neighbors together and celebrated the town’s spirit. Sarah, a young teacher in the local school, was particularly enthusiastic. She loved seeing the community unite and enjoy the festivities.\\n\\nOn the morning of the festival, Sarah woke up early. She had a busy day ahead.

Bright colors lit up the sky, and everyone watched in awe. It was a perfect end to a wonderful day.\\n\\nTired but happy, Sarah walked home. The day had been filled with activities, laughter, and good company. She reflected on the success of the festival and how it brought everyone together. It was these simple joys and connections that made her love her town even more.\\n\\nIn a bustling city, a major conference was about to take place at the Grand Hotel.

She spent her days painting vibrant scenes of nature and dreaming of a love that would make her heart dance.\\n\\nOne afternoon, while lost in the strokes of her canvas at a bustling coffee shop, her eyes met those of a handsome stranger. His name was Ethan, a passionate writer with a gentle smile that could melt hearts. Their eyes locked, and in that moment, time seemed to stand still.\\n\\nEthan approached Emily with a shy yet warm greeting. He admired her artwork and found himself drawn to her creative soul. Their conversation flowed effortlessly, filled with laughter and shared dreams. They discovered a mutual love for poetry and long walks under starry skies.\\n\\nTheir connection grew stronger with each passing day. They would meet at the same café, sipping coffee and sharing snippets of their lives. Emily would show Ethan her latest paintings, and he would read her his newest verses.\\n\\nOn a radiant spring day, Ethan surprised Emily with a bouquet of her favorite flowers, roses in shades of crimson and blush. He took her hand and led her on a whimsical stroll through a blooming garden. They laughed, danced, and embraced amidst the fragrant blossoms.\\n\\nTheir love blossomed like the flowers around them, tender and vibrant. They shared secrets, hopes, and dreams, creating a world woven with affectionate words and sweet gestures. Their hearts intertwined, beating in harmony.\\n\\nOne evening, under a sky painted with hues of pink and orange, Ethan took Emily to a hilltop overlooking the city. He confessed his love, reciting a poem he had written just for her. Emily\\'s eyes glistened with joy as she whispered, \"I love you too,\" her heart overflowing with happiness.\\n\\nTheir love story continued to flourish, filled with picnics in sun-dappled parks, stolen kisses under twinkling stars, and quiet moments of pure contentment. They vowed to cherish each other, embracing the beauty of their serendipitous encounter.\\n\\nYears later, Ethan and Emily stood hand in hand, surrounded by their artwork and poetry, reminiscing about their journey of love. Their love had grown deeper and stronger, a testament to the magic of two souls finding each other in a world brimming with love.\\n\\nJulie had always been a dreamer. From her small apartment in the city, she gazed out of her window at the busy streets below, imagining a life filled with adventure and purpose. Her job at the local library was comfortable but monotonous, and she often found herself lost in the pages of books, living vicariously through their characters.\\n\\nOne ordinary Tuesday, Julie\\'s life took an unexpected turn. She received a letter from a law firm informing her that her distant aunt, whom she barely remembered, had left her a small cottage in the countryside. Julie was astonished. She had never considered the possibility of such an inheritance.\\n\\nThe following weekend, driven by a mix of curiosity and excitement, Julie decided to visit the cottage. The journey took her through winding roads and rolling hills. As she drove, she felt her worries slip away, replaced by a sense of freedom.\\n\\nThe cottage was nestled in a quaint village, surrounded by lush gardens and overlooking a serene lake. It was charming, with ivy climbing its stone walls and a small porch adorned with flower pots. Julie immediately fell in love with it.\\n\\nIn the village, she met friendly faces who welcomed her warmly. There was Mrs. Baker, who ran the local bakery, always ready with a fresh pie and a kind word. Mr. Green, the gardener, who knew everything about flowers and plants. And there was Tom, a young man who helped at the local farm, always wearing a cheerful grin.\\n\\nJulie\\'s days in the village were peaceful and fulfilling. She helped Mrs. Baker in the bakery, learning to knead dough and ice cakes. She spent afternoons with Mr. Green, tending to the gardens, her hands deep in the earth. And with Tom, she discovered the joys of countryside life, from early morning farm chores to leisurely walks by the lake.\\n\\nAs weeks turned into months, Julie realized she had found a place where she truly belonged. She started a small book club in the village, inviting everyone to share and discuss their favorite stories. The club quickly became a hit, with villagers young and old participating.\\n\\nOne evening, as the book club gathered on her porch, Julie looked around at the smiling faces, the animated discussions, and the sense of community. She felt a profound gratitude for the unexpected twist in her life. The cottage, the village, and its people had given her a new beginning.\\n\\nShe thought back to her life in the city, to the days she spent dreaming of something more. Now, surrounded by friends and the beauty of the countryside, she realized she had found what she had always been searching for: a life filled with simplicity, joy, and meaning.\\n\\nYears passed, and Julie\\'s roots in the village grew deeper. She became a cornerstone of the community, known for her kindness and love for books. The cottage, once an inheritance from a forgotten relative, became a home filled with memories, laughter, and love.\\n\\nEmily, a young and ambitious marketing manager, lived in a bustling city, her life a whirlwind of meetings, emails, and coffee runs. Despite her success, she often felt something was missing. She longed for a break from the routine, a chance to explore and find new inspiration.\\n\\nOne day, Emily received an unexpected email. Her company was offering a chance to work abroad for a month in their Paris office. Excited and slightly nervous, she accepted the offer. This was the change she had been craving.\\n\\nPacking her bags was a flurry of activity. She filled her suitcase with essentials and a few comforts from home. Saying goodbye to her friends and family was bittersweet, but they were all supportive and promised to keep in touch.\\n\\nThe flight to Paris was long, and Emily spent most of it going over her French phrases and planning her first week. When she finally arrived, the city was everything she had dreamed of and more. The charming streets, the aroma of fresh pastries, and the beautiful language all around her filled her with joy.\\n\\nHer first day at the Paris office was a mix of excitement and nerves. She was greeted warmly by her new colleagues, who showed her around and introduced her to the local work culture. Despite the language barrier, Emily found ways to communicate and connect with her team.\\n\\nIn her free time, Emily explored Paris. She visited famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and Notre-Dame Cathedral. She strolled along the Seine, ate croissants at quaint cafes, and shopped in stylish boutiques.\\n\\nEach new experience was thrilling, but also challenging. Navigating the metro, ordering food, and even doing laundry in a foreign language took patience and a sense of humor. Emily found herself growing with each small adventure, becoming more confident and adaptable.\\n\\nOne weekend, Emily decided to take a trip to the countryside. She rented a car and drove through picturesque villages and vineyards. She stopped at a small winery, where she met an elderly couple who owned it. They didn\\'t speak much English, but their hospitality was warm and inviting. They shared their wine and stories, and Emily felt a deep connection to the place and its people.\\n\\nBack in Paris, Emily\\'s project at work was taking shape. She was creating a marketing campaign that combined her fresh perspective with the local team\\'s insights. The collaboration was a success, and her superiors were impressed with her innovative approach.\\n\\nAs her month in Paris came to an end, Emily reflected on her journey. She had sought a change and found so much more. She had discovered new aspects of herself, made lasting friendships, and gained invaluable professional experience.\\n\\nReturning home, Emily felt a mix of sadness and excitement. She had missed her city, her friends, and her routine, but she was also bringing back a renewed spirit and a broader outlook on life.\\n\\nHer adventure in Paris had taught her the importance of stepping out of her comfort zone, embracing new experiences, and the beauty of different cultures. Emily knew that this was just the beginning of many more journeys to come.\\n\\nIn a small, bustling town, Sarah, a young teacher, lived a life filled with simple joys and challenges. Her days were a blend of laughter, learning, and the occasional hurdle, teaching her to navigate the complexities of life with grace and resilience.\\n\\nOne sunny morning, Sarah received a message from her old college friend, Mike, who was visiting town. They hadn\\'t seen each other in years, and the prospect of reuniting brought a wave of nostalgia and excitement. They agreed to meet at a local café, a cozy spot known for its delicious pastries and warm ambiance.\\n\\nAs Sarah walked to the café, she passed by the familiar sights of her town - children playing in the park, neighbors walking their dogs, and the small shops that lined the streets. Each sight was a thread in the tapestry of her daily life.\\n\\nAt the café, Sarah found Mike waiting. Their greeting was a burst of joy, hugging and laughing, filling the air with warmth. As they settled down with their coffee, the conversation flowed effortlessly, jumping from past memories to present life and future dreams.\\n\\nMike shared stories of his travels and work as a photographer. His eyes sparkled with passion as he spoke of the various cultures he\\'d experienced and the beauty he\\'d captured through his lens. Sarah listened, fascinated and inspired by his adventures.\\n\\nIn turn, Sarah spoke of her life as a teacher, the challenges, and fulfillment it brought. She shared funny anecdotes about her students and the lessons they taught her. Their conversation was a beautiful dance of experiences and perspectives, enriching and enlightening.\\n\\nAs the afternoon waned, Mike suggested a walk through the old part of town, an area rich in history and charm. They strolled through cobbled streets, admiring the architecture and the play of light and shadow. Their walk led them to a small art gallery, showcasing local artists.\\n\\nInside, the walls were adorned with paintings and sculptures, each piece telling its own story. Sarah felt a deep connection to the art, each brush stroke and shape speaking to her soul. It was a reminder of the beauty and depth of human expression.\\n\\nThe day turned to evening, and the air grew cooler. Sarah and Mike found themselves at a small park, watching the sunset paint the sky in hues of orange and pink. They talked about life\\'s uncertainties and the beauty of embracing change.\\n\\nAs they parted ways, promising to keep in touch, Sarah felt a deep sense of gratitude. The day had been a tapestry of emotions, memories, and new experiences. She realized that life, with its ups and downs, was a beautiful journey of growth and discovery.\\n\\nWalking back home, under the stars, Sarah knew that each day was a gift, filled with moments to cherish, learn, and share. Life was a mosaic of stories, and she was eager to see what colors the next day would bring.\\n\\nIn a quaint seaside town, there lived a man named Tom, a seasoned fisherman known for his kind heart and wise words. Tom\\'s life was deeply intertwined with the sea, its tides mirroring the ebbs and flows of his own journey.\\n\\nOne brisk autumn morning, while preparing his boat for a day\\'s catch, Tom was approached by Anna, a young woman new to the town, her face alight with curiosity. She was a writer, seeking stories and inspiration from the lives woven into this coastal haven.\\n\\nTom, with a smile as wide as the ocean, welcomed her questions. He spoke of his years at sea, of storms weathered and serene sunsets, of loneliness and camaraderie. His words painted vivid images, each sentence a brushstroke in a vast, ever-changing seascape.\\n\\nAnna listened, captivated. She saw in Tom\\'s tales a reflection of life itself – unpredictable, beautiful, sometimes harsh, but always moving forward. She shared her own story, of travels and dreams, of seeking a place that felt like home.\\n\\nTheir conversation was a tapestry of past and present, dreams and realities. They talked of change, the inevitable force that shaped their choices and paths. Tom, with the wisdom of years, spoke of change as a friend, an ally in the journey of life.\\n\\nAs the days grew shorter and the nights colder, Anna found herself drawn to the rhythm of the town, its people, and the timeless dance of the sea. She spent her days writing, her words inspired by the stories she gathered, each one a thread in the rich fabric of the community.\\n\\nTom and Anna often met, their conversations a cherished routine. They discussed everything from the trivial to the profound – the weather, the tides, hopes, and fears. In Tom, Anna found a mentor, and in Anna, Tom saw a kindred spirit.\\n\\nWinter arrived, blanketing the town in snow, transforming the landscape into a wonderland of white. The sea, too, changed, its blues turning steely and waves growing more assertive. Tom\\'s fishing trips became less frequent, giving him time to reflect on years gone by.\\n\\nAnna\\'s writing flourished, her stories a warm light in the cold winter. She wrote of the town and its people, of Tom and the sea, her words a bridge connecting the community\\'s past with its present.\\n\\nAs spring\\'s warmth melted the snow and coaxed green from the earth, change was once again afoot. Anna received news of a book deal, a chance to share her stories with the world. The town celebrated her success, their joy a testament to the bonds she had formed.\\n\\nTom, proud and supportive, knew Anna\\'s time in the town was nearing its end. But he also understood that their paths had crossed for a reason, each impacting the other\\'s life in profound ways.\\n\\nWhen summer arrived with its promise of new beginnings, Anna prepared to leave, her heart heavy yet hopeful. She and Tom stood by the sea one last time, the horizon wide and infinite before them.\\n\\nTheir goodbye was a mix of tears and smiles, of gratitude and hope. They promised to keep in touch, to continue sharing stories and lessons.\\n\\nAs Anna drove away, she carried with her more than just her writings. She carried a part of the town, of Tom, and of the sea. And Tom, returning to his boat, felt a renewed sense of purpose, his life enriched by the young writer who had sought his stories.\\n\\nOnce upon a time, in a small, peaceful village, there lived a young girl named Lily. Lily was known for her curiosity and adventurous spirit. One day, while exploring the woods near her home, she stumbled upon a mysterious, old key lying beneath a bush.\\n\\nIntrigued, Lily picked up the key. It was rusty but had intricate designs carved into it, unlike any key she had seen before. She decided to find out what the key unlocked. She showed it to her grandfather, who was wise and knew many stories about the village.\\n\\nHer grandfather looked at the key with wide eyes. \"This,\" he said slowly, \"is the key to the old Windmill on the hill. It has been locked for as many years as I can remember.\" Lily\\'s excitement grew. She had always been fascinated by the old Windmill that stood silently overlooking the village.\\n\\nThe next morning, with the key safely in her pocket, Lily set off towards the hill. Birds chirped cheerfully, and the sun shone brightly, making her journey pleasant. When she reached the Windmill, she hesitated for a moment, then inserted the key into the lock. It turned with a creak, and the door slowly opened.\\n\\nInside, the Windmill was dusty and filled with cobwebs. Sunlight streamed through cracks in the walls, creating patterns on the floor. As Lily explored, she found an old book with a leather cover, lying on a wooden table. The book was a collection of stories about the village and its history.\\n\\nLily spent hours reading the book, learning about her village\\'s past, the people who had lived there, and their adventures. She realized that every person in the book had contributed to the village in their own way. Inspired, Lily decided she would find ways to help her village, just like the people in the stories.\\n\\nFrom that day on, Lily used her knowledge and curiosity for the betterment of her village. She helped solve problems, shared stories from the old book, and even organized the restoration of the Windmill, turning it into a place for the community to gather.\\n\\nThe key, which had unlocked more than just a door, was now a cherished possession of Lily\\'s, a reminder that even small discoveries can lead to great adventures and positive changes.\\n\\nKLE Technological University was earlier known as B.V. Bhoomaraddi College of Engineering and Technology. BVBCET was started as a college in the year 1947 and later in 2015 it got status of State Private University and was renamed as KLE Technological University. The university has been ranked in top 200 institute of the country by NIRF-2022. The university has also been ranked among India’s top 25 private Universities by ATAL 2020. The university is functional at three different locations, first is Hubballi at BV Bhoomraddi College and other two are DR. M.S. Shedhgiri Campus, Belgaumn and KLE Law Campus, Bengaluru.\\n\\nThe university functions at BV Bhoomraddi campus at Hubballi. The university is approved by UGC and AICTE. The university at campus offers 40+ courses at UG and PG level. The university also promotes research and innovation skill in students. Below mentioned are some key highlights around KLE Technological University:\\n\\nKLE Technological University (KLE Tech) has its roots in one of the premier engineering institution of Karnataka, B. V. Bhoomaraddi College of Engineering and Technology, Hubli (BVB). The founding organization KLE Society, Belgaum, established BVB college in 1947 with an aspiration of creating an institution that would lay the foundation of modern engineering education in northern region of Karnataka. Over the years, it evolved to reach and hold a unique position of pride in the technical education system of India. As we entered into the 21st century, the college undertook comprehensive reform process to adapt to the challenging global engineering education scenario.\\n\\nIn pursuit of academic excellence, the college attained academic autonomy from University Grant Commission (UGC) in the year 2007. As an autonomous college, BVB established its distinctive character in the academic space through its curriculum and outstanding student experience. Over the time it gained tremendous credibility with the industries and employers and emerged as a brand to reckon with. The Alumni of the Institute have done exceedingly well in all spheres of life at both national and international levels and brought name and fame for themselves as well as to their Alma Mater.\\n\\nThe times have changed, and the higher educational institutions need to continually innovate to maintain and enhance their relevance to meet the ever changing demands of global economies. Apart from delivering good quality education, the institutions are expected to develop their capacity in research and innovation. They also need to undergo a fundamental transformation in terms of their role in the society, mode of operation, and economic structure and the scale at which they operate.\\n\\nKeeping the above challenges in mind BVB College of Engineering and Technology,undertook strategic initiative of transforming itself into a University of national distinction. In 2014 the college was recognized as a state private University by Government of Karnataka. The rich heritage of BVB College as one of the best engineering college combined with brand equity of KLE Society are the starting points for KLE Technological University to emerge as a University with a national distinction. \\n\\nEngineering education is going through a profound transformation driven by the new realities and opportunities created by the global knowledge society. To ensure the fitness of higher education system to negotiate new challenges, adaptation of proper academic frameworks and strategic interventions are necessary. Outcome Based Education (OBE) framework has emerged as a major reform model in the global engineering education scenario and has been mandated for accreditation of engineering programs for the Washington accord signatories. The OBE approach is based on a student centered learning philosophy  and focuses on the output (outcomes) instead of the input (content). KLE Tech reform process by adopting OBE framework. The framework gives us an opportunity to build a culture of continuous improvement that strengthens our academic quality and inspires student achievement. \\n\\nThe curriculum of all the programs offered by KLE Tech are designed understanding the  xpectations of the stakeholders. Outcome Based Education (OBE) framework is used to design the curriculum. Each program has formulated Program Outcomes (POs) in line with Graduate attributes of NBA. These POs describe what students are expected to know and be able to do by the time of their graduation. These POs relate to the knowledge, skills, and behaviours that students acquire as they progress through the program. The courses designed for the programs are aligned to the expectations of POs.\\n\\nLearning experiences in each of the programs are created focusing the millennial learner. Problem solving skills, research and entrepreneurship are embedded in the curriculum through a host of program core, program elective and open elective courses. Active, blended, collaborative, experiential and project based learning (PBL) practices are used bringing student to the centre of teaching – learning process. Assessment and evaluations are done aligning to learning outcomes to inform both the learner and the system. The frame work adopted by the University is depicted in the Figure below.\\n\\n‘Engineering Design’ course which was being offered to Mechanical and Electrical domain students at the 3rd semester has been restructured to offer product development experience in an inter-disciplinary environment. This is an attempt probably first of its kind in the engineering education scenario at a large scale. It is a 3 credit course which will engage students from determining the customer’s needs, developing specifications, generating conceptual designs, designing the final product and virtual prototyping. The classes are conducted in two parts. Part-I is offered to a division in a studio mode to 12 teams with each team consisting of 6 students – 2 each from Mechanical, Electrical and Computer Science domains. There are 15 divisions consisting of 1080 students all put together from Mechanical, Electronics & Communication, Compute Science, Automation & Robotics and Electrical & Electronics Engineering disciplines. The Part-II is offered at the respective department laboratories to inculcate the required skills among students in using the various tools to accomplish the task of virtual prototyping.\\n\\nAs an extension to the ‘Engineering Design’, another course ‘Product Realization’ has been a 2 credit  course introduced at the 4th semester. During this course, the emphasis is on the concurrent and collaborative process of arriving at the best solutions at each step in the hardware and software development processes and assuring that the total process is optimized with the best of knowledge and tools. At the end of this course, the student teams who have already executed a virtual prototype in the previous semester, are required to build in MakerSpace - a specially established state-of-the-art comprehensive manufacturing facility (mechanical & electronic) and demonstrate the working of an electromechanical prototype augmented with IoT technology.\\n\\nThe two courses together provide multi-disciplinary, systems-perspective to problem solving. These courses force a systems-perspective by using a `complete\\' product development process, i.e., the students must take a product from its idea phase to manufactured product. Students no longer focus on individual parts at the expense of the entire system. These courses establish the fact that an innovation in undergraduate course work will have profound implications on students, essentially enabling them to handle real- world problems. The key takeaway from these courses for the young designers would be to provide an orderly process for organizing an ill-structured design activity in order to support making decisions and trade-offs among possibly competing solutions.\\n\\nIn addition to their primary area of study, undergraduate Engineering students have the opportunity to study one of the Minors offered by departments/schools/centers in some of the most interesting areas in the profession today. Engineering Minors allow students to gain interdisciplinary experience and exposure to concepts and perspectives that may not be a part of their degree program—thus widening their understanding of the engineering profession and the issues that impact engineers.\\n\\nUpon completion of an Engineering Minor, students will also be better equipped to perform interdisciplinary research. Engineering Minors can generally be completed within a regular degree - some extra courses may be required depending on Minor offering department/school/centre. A separate certificate shall be issued on completion of the Minor discipline requirements. Minor is an additional credential a student will earn if s/he does additional learning of 5 courses in a discipline other than her/his major discipline. KLE Technological University is offering following UG Minor programmes: 1. Minor in Entrepreneurship 2. Minor in Electronics 3. Minor in Computer Science & Engineering 4. Minor in Innovation and Product Development 5. Minor in Robotics and 6. Minor in Automotive Engineering.\\n\\n2016-17 was Good Year for Placements. Most of the companies hired moderately high number of students from our college and also many new companies visited. Big hires in Software Services include -- Accenture (372), Infosys (207) and in Core sector include -- Robert Bosch (67), KPIT (66), Mercedes Benz(27).\\n\\nResearch and Innovation To meet its growth aspirations, one of the challenges faced by the Univeristy is to transform itself from a good teaching institute to an excellent teaching and research institute. It is important that we need to further the research and developmental activities for the following: • To sustain academic and professional reputation in knowledge-based economy • To attract and retain high quality faculty and students • To maintain cutting-edge curriculum and create stimulating learning environment • To improve undergraduate teaching, because a researcher; (i) is a better thinker and problem solver, (ii) can promote active teaching & (iii) can create enthusiasm • To align academic activities with economic development of the region. Research centers KLE TECH has 12 research centers with 75 doctoral faculty guiding 67 registered doctoral students at KLE Tech and 151 students registered in other universities. The following table presents details about the researchcenters.\\n\\nKLE Tech awarded as Ranked No 1 for “Outstanding Institutional Transformation in Engineering Education” by Indo Universal Collaboration for Engineering Education (IUCEE) . Dr. Ashok Shettar received award on Jan 8th 2017 in Vardhaman College of Engineering, Hyderabad. Four faculty members of KLE Technological University were honored with all the four awards for for thier valuable contributions in the field of Engineering Education. The awards were instituted by IUCEE for the first time and were presented during International Conference on Transformations in Engineering Education (ICTIEE)-2017 held during January, 2017. The faculty members received their awards at Vardhaman College of Engineering, Hyderabad on Jan 8th 2017 and in RK University, Rajkot on Jan 9th 2017.\\n\\nBVB College of Engineering and Technology, Hubballi, won the “RUNNERSUP TROPHY” during the 3-days State Level Project Exhibition and Competition organized by Akhila Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad at R.V.   College of Engineering & Technology, Bengaluru.\\n\\nBVB-KLE Tech Team Concept Green, in the 2016-17 edition of SAE India E-Baja, the biggest ATV Event in India, bagged the Best Engineering Design Award, 2nd in Durability and also finished as Runners-up at the event. The Team scripted BVB’s major breakthrough in SAE Events.\\nFreedom fighters were people who sacrificed their lives selflessly for the freedom of their country.\\nEvery country has its fair share of freedom fighters.\\nPeople look up to them in terms of patriotism and love for one’s country. \\nThey are considered the epitome of patriotic people.\\nFreedom fighters made sacrifices which one cannot even imagine of doing for their loved ones, leave alone the country. \\nThe amount of pain, hardships, and opposite they have endured cannot be put into words. \\nThe generations after them will always be indebted to them for their selfless sacrifices and hard work.\\nOne cannot emphasize enough on the importance of freedom fighters. \\nAfter all, they are the ones because of whom we celebrate Independence Day. \\nNo matter how small a role they played, they are very much significant today as they were in those times. \\nMoreover, they revolted against the colonizers so as to stand up for the country and its people.\\nFurthermore, most of the freedom fighters even went to war to safeguard the freedom of their people. \\nIt did not matter that they had no training; they did it for the pure intention of making their country free. \\nMost of the freedom fighters sacrificed their lives in the war for independence.\\nMost importantly, freedom fighters inspired and motivated others to fight injustice. \\nThey are the pillars behind the freedom movement. They made people aware of their rights and their power. \\nIt is all because of the freedom fighters that we prospered into a free country free from any kind of colonizers or injustice.\\nIndia has seen a lot of freedom fighters fight for their motherland. \\nWhile I respect each and every one of them equally, I have a few personal favorites who inspired me to work for my country. \\nFirstly, I completely adore the father of the nation, Mahatma Gandhi. \\nI like him because he chose the path of non-violence and won freedom without any weapons, only the truth and peace.\\nSecondly, Rani Lakshmi Bai was a great freedom fighter. \\nI have learned so many things from this empowering woman. \\nShe fought for the country despite so many hardships. \\nA mother never gave up her country because of her child, instead took him to the battlefield to fight against injustice. \\nMoreover, she was so inspiring in numerous ways.\\nNext, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose comes in my list. \\nHe led the Indian National Army to show the power of India to the British. \\nHis famous line remains to be give me your blood and I will give you freedom.\\nFinally, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was also one of the greatest leaders. \\nDespite being from a rich family, he gave up the easy life and fought for India’s freedom. \\nHe was imprisoned a number of times but that did not stop him from fighting against injustice. \\nHe was a great inspiration to many.\\nIn short, freedom fighters are what made our country what it is today. \\nHowever, we see nowadays people are fighting for everything they stood against. \\nWe must come together to not let communal hatred come between and live up to the Indian dream of these freedom fighters. \\nOnly then will we honor their sacrifices and memory.\\nThe freedom of a country depends on its citizens. \\nIndividuals who selflessly sacrifice their lives so that their country and country men can be free are identified as freedom fighters. \\nEvery country has a few brave hearts who willingly give up their lives for their countrymen. \\nFreedom fighters did not only fight for their country but for everyone who suffered in silence, lost their family and freedom, and even their rights to live for themselves. \\nPeople of the country look up to the freedom fighters with respect for their patriotism and the love they had for their motherland. \\nThese people provide examples by which other citizens aim to live by.\\nFor ordinary people, sacrificing their lives is a big deal but freedom fighters selflessly make this unimaginable sacrifice for their country without thinking of any repercussion. \\nThe amount of pain and hardships that they have to endure to achieve their goal cannot be described in mere words. \\nThe entire country remains forever indebted to them for their struggles.\\nThe Influence Left by the Freedom Fighters\\nOne can\\'t stress enough the importance of the deeds of the freedom fighters. \\nOn every Independence Day, the country remembers the thousands who once struggled so that their countrymen could be free. \\nTheir sacrifices are never forgotten by their countrymen. \\nIf we delve into history, we see most freedom fighters joined the freedom struggle without prior formal training in war or related fields. \\nThey went to wars and protests knowing very well that they may get killed by the opposite power. \\nThe freedom fighters were not just people who fought with arms against the tyrants but they were people who joined protests through literature, legal advocates, people who contributed money to the freedom struggle, and so on. \\nMost of the brave hearts led the fight against foreign powers. \\nThey made their fellow people realize their rights and pointed out all the existing social injustice and crimes committed by the ones in power. \\nThe most important effect that the freedom fighters left on the people of the society are that they inspired others to understand their rights and stand up against the people in power. \\nThey inspired others to join their struggle. \\nIt was because of the freedom fighters that the countrymen united with a bond of Nationalism and patriotic feelings. \\nFreedom fighters are considered to be the propelling force behind the success of the freedom struggle. \\nThey are the reason why we can now prosper in a free country.\\nIndia had been under British rule for 200 years approximately. \\nThere were a lot of brave hearts who laid down their lives for the freedom of India. \\nWithin the limited scope of this essay, we will discuss the contributions made by only a few freedom fighters.\\nMahatma Gandhi is known as the father of the nation. \\nMahatma Gandhi, the reason behind the Dandi march, led the path to freedom following the principles of ahimsa or non-violence. \\nHe prioritised ‘swadeshi’ and ‘non-cooperation’ to expedite the freedom movement. \\nNetaji Subhash Chandra Bose was an excellent leader. \\nHe travelled to other countries to form alliances and formed Indian National Army (INA) or Azad Hind Fauj which eventually helped our nation prosper. \\nHe was successful in freeing a portion of the Indian Territory from British rule.\\nThe fearless patriot was hanged to death at a very young age after being convicted in several cases of dissent against the then British empire. \\nHe was indeed a true patriot and we still remember him as Shaheed Bhagat Sing. \\nFreedom fighters are the reason we live in a free country. \\nWe must honour their sacrifices and aim to live together in harmony and peace ensuring social justice. \\nThe motivation for today’s youth is alive in the stories of freedom fighters. \\nThe struggles of their lives show the difference in life and the dept of the value they believe in and fought for. \\nWe as a citizen of India should respect and honor the sacrifice by creating a peaceful environment in the country.\\nA laptop computer or notebook computer, also known as a laptop or notebook for short, is a small, portable personal computer. \\nLaptops run on both an AC power supply and a rechargeable battery pack and can be folded shut for convenient storage and transportation, making them suitable for mobile use.\\nToday, laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at work, in education, for playing games, web browsing, for personal multimedia, and for general home computer use.\\nThe names \"laptop\" and \"notebook\" refer to the fact that the computer can be practically placed on the user\\'s lap and can be used similarly to a notebook. \\nAmerican English, the terms \"laptop\" and \"notebook\" are used interchangeably in other dialects of English, one or the other may be preferred.\\nAlthough the term \"notebook\" originally referred to a specific size of laptop the term has come to mean the same thing and no longer refers to any specific size.\\nLaptops combine many of the input/output components and capabilities of a desktop computer into a single unit, including a display screen, small speakers, a keyboard, and a pointing device .\\nMost modern laptops include a built-in webcam and microphone, and many also have a touchscreen. \\nLaptops can be powered by an internal battery or an external power supply by using an AC adapter. \\nHardware specifications may vary significantly between different types, models, and price points.\\nDesign elements, form factors, and construction can also vary significantly between models depending on the intended use. \\nExamples of specialized models of laptops. \\nAs portable computers evolved into modern laptops, they became widely used for a variety of purposes.\\nAs the personal computer (PC) became feasible in 1971, the idea of a portable personal computer soon followed. \\nA \"personal, portable information manipulator\" was imagined by Alan Kay at Xerox PARC in 1968, and described in his 1972 paper as the \"Dynabook\". \\nThe IBM Special Computer APL Machine Portable (SCAMP) was demonstrated in 1973.\\nThis prototype was based on the IBM PALM processor.\\nThe IBM 5100, the first commercially available portable computer, appeared in September 1975, and was based on the SCAMP prototype.\\nAs 8-bit CPU machines became widely accepted, the number of portables increased rapidly. \\nThe first \"laptop-sized notebook computer\" was the Epson HX-20,invented (patented) by Suwa Seikosha\\'s Yukio Yokozawa in July 1980.\\nintroduced at the COMDEX computer show in Las Vegas by Japanese company Seiko Epson in 1981,and released in July 1982.\\nIt had an LCD screen, a rechargeable battery, and a calculator-size printer, in a 1.6 kg (3.5 lb) chassis, the size of an A4 notebook.\\nIt was described as a \"laptop\" and \"notebook\" computer in its patent.\\nThe Epson HX-20, the first \"laptop computer\", was invented in 1980 and introduced in 1981.\\nThe portable micro computer Portal of the French company R2E Micral CCMC officially appeared in September 1980 at the Sicob show in Paris. \\nIt was a portable microcomputer designed and marketed by the studies and developments department of R2E Micral at the request of the company CCMC specializing in payroll and accounting. \\nIt was based on an Intel 8085 processor, 8-bit, clocked at 2 MHz. \\nIt weighed 12 kg and its dimensions were 45\\u2009×\\u200945\\u2009×\\u200915 cm. \\nIt provided total mobility. Its operating system was aptly named Prologue.\\nThe Osborne 1, released in 1981, was a luggable computer that used the Zilog Z80 CPU and weighed 24.5 pounds. \\nIt had no battery, a 5 in (13 cm) cathode-ray tube (CRT) screen, and dual 5.25 in (13.3 cm) single-density floppy drives. \\nBoth Tandy/RadioShack and Hewlett-Packard (HP) also produced portable computers of varying designs during this period.\\nThe first laptops using the flip form factor appeared in the early 1980s. \\nThe Dulmont Magnum was released in Australia in 1981–82, but was not marketed internationally until 1984–85. \\nThe US$8,150 GRiD Compass 1101, released in 1982, was used at NASA and by the military, among others.\\nThe Sharp PC-5000, Ampere and Gavilan SC released in 1983. \\nThe Gavilan SC was described as a \"laptop\" by its manufacturer,while the Ampere had a modern clamshell design.\\nThe Toshiba T1100 won acceptance not only among PC experts but the mass market as a way to have PC portability.\\nFrom 1983 onward, several new input techniques were developed and included in laptops, including the touch pad, the pointing stick, and handwriting recognition.\\nA Zenith SupersPort laptop, released in 1988.\\nCommon resolutions of laptop webcams are 720p (HD), and in lower-end laptops 480p. \\nThe earliest known laptops with 1080p (Full HD) webcams like the Samsung 700G7C were released in the early 2010s.\\nWhile the terms laptop and notebook are used interchangeably today, there are some questions as to the original etymology and specificity of either term. \\nThe term laptop was coined in 1983 to describe a mobile computer which could be used on one\\'s lap, and to distinguish these devices from earlier and much heavier portable computers.\\nThe term notebook appears to have gained currency somewhat later as manufacturers started producing even smaller portable devices, further reducing their weight and size.\\nSanatana dharma, in Hinduism, term used to denote the “eternal” or absolute set of duties or religiously ordained practices incumbent upon all Hindus, regardless of class, caste, or sect. \\nDifferent texts give different lists of the duties, but in general sanatana dharma consists of virtues such as honesty, refraining from injuring living beings, purity, goodwill, mercy, patience, forbearance, self-restraint, generosity, and asceticism. \\nSanatana dharma is contrasted with svadharma, one’s “own duty” or the particular duties enjoined upon an individual according to his or her class or caste and stage of life. \\nThe potential for conflict between the two types of dharma in Hindu texts such as the Bhagavad Gita, where it is said that in such cases svadharma must prevail.\\nThe term has also more recently been used by Hindu leaders, reformers, and nationalists to refer to Hinduism as a unified world religion. \\nSanatana dharma has thus become a synonym for the “eternal” truth and teachings of Hinduism, the latter conceived of as not only transcendent of history and unchanging but also as indivisible and ultimately nonsectarian.\\nHindu deities are the gods and goddesses in Hinduism. Deities in Hinduism are as diverse as its traditions, and a Hindu can choose to be polytheistic, pantheistic, monotheistic, monistic, even agnostic, atheistic, or humanist.\\nThe terms and epithets for deities within the diverse traditions of Hinduism vary, and include Deva, Devi, Ishvara, Ishvari, Bhagavān and Bhagavati.\\nThe deities of Hinduism have evolved from the Vedic era through the medieval era, regionally within Nepal, Pakistan, India and in Southeast Asia, and across Hinduism\\'s diverse traditions.\\nThe Hindu deity concept varies from a personal god as in Yoga school of Hindu philosophy,to thirty-three major deities in the Vedas, to hundreds of deities mentioned in the Puranas of Hinduism.\\nIllustrations of major deities include Vishnu, Lakshmi, Shiva, Parvati, Brahma and Saraswati. \\nThese deities have distinct and complex personalities, yet are often viewed as aspects of the same Ultimate Reality called Brahman.\\nFrom ancient times, the idea of equivalence has been cherished for all Hindus, in its texts and in early 1st-millennium sculpture with concepts such as Harihara and Ardhanārīshvara with myths and temples that feature them together, declaring they are the same.\\nMajor deities have inspired their own Hindu traditions, such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism, but with shared mythology, ritual grammar, theosophy, axiology and polycentrism.\\nsome Hindu traditions, such as Smartism from the mid 1st millennium CE, have included multiple major deities as henotheistic manifestations of Saguna Brahman, and as a means to realizing Nirguna Brahman.\\nIn Samkhya philosophy, Devata or deities are considered as \"natural sources of energy\" who have Sattva as the dominant Guna.\\nHindu deities are represented with various icons and anicons, in paintings and sculptures, called Murtis and Pratimas.\\nSome Hindu traditions, such as ancient Charvakas, rejected all deities and concept of god or goddess,while 19th-century British colonial era movements such as the Arya Samaj and Brahmo Samaj rejected deities and adopted monotheistic concepts similar to Abrahamic religions.\\nHindu deities have been adopted in other religions such as Jainism,and in regions outside India, such as predominantly Buddhist Thailand and Japan, where they continue to be revered in regional temples or arts.\\nIn ancient and medieval era texts of Hinduism, the human body is described as a temple,and deities are described to be parts residing within it, while the Brahman is described to be the same, or of similar nature, as the Atman  Hindus believe is eternal and within every living being.\\nGanesha, elephant-headed Hindu god of beginnings, who is traditionally worshipped before any major enterprise and is the patron of intellectuals, bankers, scribes, and authors. \\nHis name means both “Lord of the People” and “Lord of the Ganas”.\\nGanesha is potbellied and generally depicted as holding in his hand a few round Indian sweets, of which he is inordinately fond. \\nHis vehicle (vahana) is the large Indian bandicoot rat, which symbolizes Ganesha’s ability to overcome anything to get what he wants. \\nLike a rat and like an elephant, Ganesha is a remover of obstacles. \\nThe 10-day late-summer (August–September) festival Ganesh Chaturthi is devoted to him.\\nStatue of Ganesha, the Hindu god of beginnings.\\nMany different stories are told about the birth of Ganesha, including one in which Parvati makes her son out of a piece of cloth and asks her consort, Shiva, to bring him to life. \\nOne of the best-known myths, however, begins with Parvati taking a bath and longing for someone to keep Shiva from barging in on her, as was his habit. \\nAs she bathes, she kneads the dirt that she rubs off her body into the shape of a child, who comes to life. \\nBut when Shiva sees the handsome young boy—or when the inauspicious planet Saturn (Shani) glances at him, in some variants of the myth that attempt to absolve Shiva of the crime—he or one of his attendants cuts off the child’s head. \\nWhen Shiva cuts off an elephant’s head to bestow it on the headless Ganesha, one of the tusks is shattered, and Ganesha is depicted holding the broken-off piece in his hand. \\nAccording to this version of the myth, Ganesha is the child of Parvati alone—indeed, a child born despite Shiva’s negative intervention. \\nYet Ganesha is traditionally regarded as the child of both Shiva and Parvati.\\nThe construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya is a monumental event deeply rooted in India\\'s cultural and historical tapestry.\\nIt signifies the end of a long-standing dispute and the beginning of a new era of religious harmony.\\nThe Ayodhya issue dates back several centuries, marked by a complex history of religious, political, and social implications. \\nThe epic Ramayana, a revered scripture in Hinduism, narrates the life of Lord Rama, the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu. \\nAyodhya, his birthplace, holds profound significance for millions of Hindus worldwide.\\nThe controversy surrounding the Babri Masjid, built in the 16th century, intensified in the late 20th century, leading to communal tensions and disputes. \\nThe legal battle over the land became a focal point of national attention.\\nThe journey towards the construction of the Ram Mandir was marked by

When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. \\nThey communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match\\'s statistical information.\\nForms of cricket range from Twenty20 (also known as T20), with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs the game generally lasting three to four hours, to Test matches played over five days. \\nTraditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. \\nIn addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.\\nThe earliest known definite reference to cricket is to it being played in South East England in the mid-16th century. \\nIt spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. \\nThe game\\'s governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. \\nThe game\\'s rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. \\nThe sport is followed primarily in South Asia, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Southern Africa and the West Indies.\\nWomen\\'s cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard.\\nThe most successful side playing international cricket is Australia, which has won eight One Day International trophies, including six World Cups, more than any other country and has been the top-rated Test side more than any other country.\\nA medieval \"club ball\" game involving an underarm bowl towards a batter. \\nBall catchers are shown positioning themselves to catch a ball.

the North American variant of cricket known as wicket retained many of these aspects.\\nThe ball was bowled underarm by the bowler and along the ground towards a batter armed with a bat that in shape resembled a hockey stick; the batter defended a low, two-stump wicket; and runs were called notches because the scorers recorded them by notching tally sticks.\\nIn 1611, the year Cotgrave\\'s dictionary was published, ecclesiastical court records at Sidlesham in Sussex state that two parishioners, Bartholomew Wyatt and Richard Latter, failed to attend church on Easter Sunday because they were playing cricket. \\nThey were fined 12d each and ordered to do penance.[18] This is the earliest mention of adult participation in cricket and it was around the same time that the earliest known organised inter-parish or village match was played – at Chevening, Kent.\\nIn 1624, a player called Jasper Vinall died after he was accidentally struck on the head during a match between two parish teams in Sussex.\\nCricket remained a low-key local pursuit for much of the 17th century.\\nIt is known, through numerous references found in the records of ecclesiastical court cases, to have been proscribed at times by the Puritans before and during the Commonwealth.\\nThe problem was nearly always the issue of Sunday play as the Puritans considered cricket to be \"profane\" if played on the Sabbath, especially if large crowds or gambling were involved.\\nAccording to the social historian Derek Birley, there was a \"great upsurge of sport after the Restoration\" in 1660.\\nSeveral members of the court of King Charles II took a strong interest in cricket during that era.\\nGambling on sport became a problem significant enough for Parliament to pass the 1664 Gambling Act, limiting stakes to £100 which was, in any case, a colossal sum exceeding the annual income of 99% of the population.\\nAlong with horse racing, as well as prizefighting and other types of blood sport, cricket was perceived to be a gambling sport.\\nRich patrons made matches for high stakes, forming teams in which they engaged the first professional players.\\nBy the end of the century, cricket had developed into a major sport that was spreading throughout England and was already being taken abroad by English mariners and colonisers – the earliest reference to cricket overseas is dated 1676.\\nA 1697 newspaper report survives of \"a great cricket match\" played in Sussex \"for fifty guineas apiece\" – this is the earliest known contest that is generally considered a First Class match.\\nThe patrons, and other players from the social class known as the \"gentry\", began to classify themselves as to establish a clear distinction from the professionals, who were invariably members of the working class, even to the point of having separate changing and dining facilities.\\nThe gentry, including such high-ranking nobles as the Dukes of Richmond, exerted their honour code of noblesse oblige to claim rights of leadership in any sporting contests they took part in, especially as it was necessary for them to play alongside their \"social inferiors\" if they were to win their bets.\\nIn time, a perception took hold that the typical amateur who played in first-class cricket, until 1962 when amateurism was abolished, was someone with a public school education who had then gone to one of Cambridge or Oxford University – society insisted that such people were \"officers and gentlemen\" whose destiny was to provide leadership.\\nIn a purely financial sense, the cricketing amateur would theoretically claim expenses for playing while his professional counterpart played under contract and was paid a wage or match fee; in practice, many amateurs claimed more than actual expenditure and the derisive term \"shamateur\" was coined to describe the practice.\\nEnglish cricket in the 18th and 19th centuries\\nFrancis Cotes, The Young Cricketer, 1768\\nThe game underwent major development in the 18th century to become England\\'s national sport.\\nIts success was underwritten by the twin necessities of patronage and betting.\\nCricket was prominent in London as early as 1707 and, in the middle years of the century, large crowds flocked to matches on the Artillery Ground in Finsbury.\\nThe single wicket form of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match, its popularity peaking in the 1748 season.\\nBowling underwent an evolution around 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it towards the batter. \\nThis caused a revolution in bat design because, to deal with the bouncing ball, it was necessary to introduce the modern straight bat in place of the old \"hockey stick\" shape.\\nThe Hambledon Club was founded in the 1760s and, for the next twenty years until the formation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the opening of Lord\\'s Old Ground in 1787, Hambledon was both the game\\'s greatest club and its focal point.[citation needed] MCC quickly became the sport\\'s premier club and the custodian of the Laws of Cricket. \\nNew Laws introduced in the latter part of the 18th century included the three stump wicket and leg before wicket (lbw).\\nThe 19th century saw underarm bowling superseded by first roundarm and then overarm bowling. \\nOrganisation of the game at county level led to the creation of the county clubs, starting with Sussex in 1839.\\nIn December 1889, the eight leading county clubs formed the official County Championship, which began in 1890.\\nThe first recorded photo of a cricket match taken on 25 July 1857 by Roger Fenton\\nThe most famous player of the 19th century was W.

However, in general, the presence of a correlation is not sufficient to infer the presence of a causal relationship.\\nFormally, random variables are dependent if they do not satisfy a mathematical property of probabilistic independence. \\nIn informal parlance, correlation is synonymous with dependence.\\nHowever, when used in a technical sense, correlation refers to any of several specific types of mathematical operations between the tested variables and their respective expected values. \\nEssentially, correlation is the measure of how two or more variables are related to one another. \\nOther correlation coefficients – such as Spearman\\'s rank correlation – have been developed to be more robust than Pearson\\'s, that is, more sensitive to nonlinear relationships.\\nThe Constitution of India is the supreme law of India.\\nThe document lays down the framework that demarcates fundamental political code, structure, procedures, powers, and duties of government institutions and sets out fundamental rights, directive principles, and the duties of citizens, based on the proposal M.

Roy.  \\nIt is the longest written national constitution in the world.\\nIt imparts constitutional supremacy (not parliamentary supremacy, since it was created by a constituent assembly rather than Parliament) and was adopted by its people with a declaration in its preamble.\\nParliament cannot override the constitution.\\nIt was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India on 26 November 1949 and became effective on 26 January 1950.\\nThe constitution replaced the Government of India Act 1935 as the country\\'s fundamental governing document, and the Dominion of India became the Republic of India. \\nTo ensure constitutional autochthony, its framers repealed prior acts of the British parliament in Article 395.\\nIndia celebrates its constitution on 26 January as Republic Day.\\nThe constitution declares India a sovereign, socialist, secular,[11] and democratic republic, assures its citizens justice, equality, and liberty, and endeavours to promote fraternity.\\nThe original 1950 constitution is preserved in a nitrogen-filled case at the Parliament House in New Delhi.\\nIn economics, inflation is a general increase in the prices of goods and services in an economy.\\nThis is usually measured using the consumer price index (CPI).\\nWhen the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money.\\nThe opposite of CPI inflation is deflation, a decrease in the general price level of goods and services.\\nThe common measure of inflation is the inflation rate, the annualized percentage change in a general price index.\\nAs prices faced by households do not all increase at the same rate, the consumer price index (CPI) is often used for this purpose.\\nModerate inflation affects economies in both positive and negative ways.\\nThe negative effects would include an increase in the opportunity cost of holding money, uncertainty over future inflation, which may discourage investment and savings, and, if inflation were rapid enough, shortages of goods as consumers begin hoarding out of concern.\\nPositive effects include reducing unemployment due to nominal wage rigidity,[11] allowing the central bank greater freedom in carrying out monetary policy, encouraging loans and investment instead of money hoarding, and avoiding the inefficiencies associated.\\nToday, most economists favour a low and steady rate of inflation.\\nLow (as opposed to zero or negative) inflation reduces the probability of economic recessions by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly in a downturn and reduces the risk that a liquidity trap avoiding the costs associated with high inflation. \\nA car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels. \\nMost definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people, not cargo.\\nFrench inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while French-born Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile in 1808.\\nThe modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was invented in 1886, when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. \\nCommercial cars became widely available during the 20th century. One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.\\nCars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages.\\nIn Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.\\nThe car is considered an essential part of the developed economy.\\nCars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lamps. \\nOver the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. \\nThese include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. \\nElectric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than petrol-driven cars before 2025.\\nThe transition from fossil fuel-powered cars to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown\\'s 100 actionable solutions for climate change.\\nThere are costs and benefits to car use.\\nThe costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance.\\nThe costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, noise pollution, public health, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. \\nTraffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.\\nPersonal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience.\\nSocietal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from taxes.\\nPeople\\'s ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.\\nThere are around one billion cars in use worldwide. Car usage is increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialized countries.\\nA motorcycle (motorbike, bike, or, if three-wheeled, a trike) is a two or three-wheeled motor vehicle steered by a handlebar from a saddle-style seat.\\nMotorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long-distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport (including racing), and off-road riding.\\nMotorcycling is riding a motorcycle and being involved in other related social activities such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies.\\nThe 1885 Daimler Reitwagen made by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Germany was the first internal combustion, petroleum-fueled motorcycle. In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller became the first series production motorcycle.\\nGlobally, motorcycles are comparably popular to cars as a method of transport. In 2021, approximately 58.6 million new motorcycles were sold around the world, fewer than the 66.7 million cars sold over the same period.\\nIn 2022, the top four motorcycle producers by volume and type were Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, and Suzuki.\\nIn developing countries, motorcycles are considered utilitarian due to lower prices and greater fuel economy. \\nAccording to the US Department of Transportation, the number of fatalities per vehicle mile traveled was 37 times higher for motorcycles than for cars.\\nA fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases energy as thermal energy or to be used for work. \\nThe concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy, such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion).\\nThe heat energy released by reactions of fuels can be converted into mechanical energy via a heat engine.\\nOther times, the heat itself is valued for warmth, cooking, or industrial processes, as well as the illumination that accompanies combustion.\\nFuels are also used in the cells of organisms in a process known as cellular respiration, where organic molecules are oxidized to release usable energy. \\nHydrocarbons and related organic molecules are by far the most common source of fuel used by humans, but other substances, including radioactive metals, are also utilized.\\nFuels are contrasted with other substances or devices storing potential energy, such as those that directly release electrical energy (such as batteries and capacitors) or mechanical energy (such as flywheels, springs, compressed air).\\nScience fiction (sometimes shortened to SF or sci-fi) is a genre of speculative fiction, which typically deals with imaginative and futuristic concepts such as advanced science and technology, space exploration, extraterrestrial life.\\nIt is related to fantasy, horror, and superhero fiction and contains many subgenres.\\nIts exact definition has long been disputed among authors, critics, scholars, and readers.\\nScience fiction, in literature, film, television, and other media, has become popular and influential over much of the world.\\nIt has been called the \"literature of ideas\", and has sometimes been described as an exploration of the potential consequences of scientific, social, and technological innovations.\\nBesides providing entertainment, it can also criticize present-day society and explore alternatives.\\nMechanical engineering is the study of physical machines that may involve force and movement. \\nIt is an engineering branch that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials science, to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems.\\nIt is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering branches.\\nMechanical engineering requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science, design, structural analysis, and electricity.\\nIn addition to these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and product lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants.\\nMechanical engineering emerged as a field during the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the 18th century; however, its development can be traced back several thousand years around the world.\\nThe field has continually evolved to incorporate advancements; today mechanical engineers are pursuing developments in such areas as composites, mechatronics, and nanotechnology. \\nIt also overlaps with aerospace engineering, metallurgical engineering, civil engineering, structural engineering, electrical engineering, manufacturing engineering, chemical engineering, industrial engineering, and other engineering.\\nMechanical engineers may also work in the field of biomedical engineering, specifically with biomechanics, transport phenomena, biomechatronics, bionanotechnology, and modelling of biological systems.\\nEngineering is the practice of using natural science, mathematics, and the engineering design process to solve technical problems, increase efficiency and productivity, and improve systems.\\nModern engineering comprises many subfields which include designing and improving infrastructure, machinery, vehicles, electronics, materials, and energy systems.\\nThe discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied mathematics, applied science, and types of application. \\nThe term engineering is derived from the Latin ingenium, meaning \"cleverness\" and ingeniare, meaning \"to contrive, devise\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"
