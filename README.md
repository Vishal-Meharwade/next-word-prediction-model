## ‚ú® Features

This project includes:

- **Advanced Text Preprocessing**:  
  The text is cleaned and tokenized, generating meaningful sequences for training.

- **LSTM-Based Model**:  
  The model uses LSTM layers to understand and predict patterns in the text.

- **Memory-Efficient Design**:  
  Implements garbage collection and session clearing to optimize memory usage, especially for environments like Google Colab.

- **Next Word Prediction**:  
  Predicts the most probable next word based on a given seed text, showcasing the model's understanding of language context.

- **Model Checkpointing**:  
  Saves the best-performing model automatically based on training loss, ensuring reliable results.
